I'm assuming you're going to build a fleet in Brest, and if you do so and move Bre --> Eng in the spring it would cut any support that fleet could provide and I can kick England out of the North Sea.

# ::snt SEN send to REC that Ok, I'm moving down to Rum, so you should go GoB-StP, Ukr-Mos and either hang tight with War, or really lock down StP by doing War-Lvn.  If you were playing more heavily, I'd suggest the opposite: tell England you'll not even contest StP if they take it with a fleet instead of an army, and instead throw all your armies at Germany, or go with me into eating Austria.  But that requires actually convincing England to go for it, and you don't got time for that shit right now.  So locking down StP should help, if you just want to move the pieces around the board. 🙂

There are three things here and I can only give up one otherwise I'm putting myself under way too much risk. Its either 1) you taking RUM by yourself and I wont try and stop it 2) black sea DMZ (but we'd need to bounce it) 3) me supporting you into Rum. Whichever one you take, I can't give up any of the others. I would be too far onto the back foot with you getting a freebe in the North and Austria seemingly coming for me. 1902 will be a big year and if we work this out and we play it as allies then we can both have a lot of trust going into next year which will  be really valuable.

I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.

I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either.

# ::snt SEN send to REC that I will 100% do that if that is what we want to do. I don't mean to push it too much (as I realize just Picardy is a large trust excersize), but in the interest of full disclosure, I was initially planning to send MAO to the English Channel. I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.
