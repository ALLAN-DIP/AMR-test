Italy have a somewhat crazy idea that Italy' ve always wanted to try with I / G, but Italy' ve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what's worse, it might make Germany suspicious of Italy.      So. . . do Italy suggest it?     Italy is thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That's Italy's hope anyway.     What is Germany's appetite like for unusual and crazy?

# ::snt Italy send to Germany that Yeah, Italy can't say Italy' ve tried it and it works, cause Italy' ve never tried it or seen it. But how Italy think it would work is ( a ) Italy's Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if Germany did not cover Munich. Then ( b ) Germany build two armies, which looks like Italy and Germany is really at war and Germany is going to eject Italy. Then Italy and Germany launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.     All that said, Italy' ve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for Germany, so Italy is not offended or concerned if it's just not for Germany. Italy is happy to play more conventionally too. Up to Germany.

Germany's trust in Italy is a bit shaken but Germany still think Germany and Italy can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on Germany's end.

If that's not the case, then as the filling of an England - Italy sandwich Germany is in no position to retaliate anyway.

Germany know this from experience: back when Italy were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, Germany did everything Germany could to find out what Italy were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time - buying measure, since France was outmatched and Germany would eventually run out of pretenses to extract Italy's move.

Germany got Italy to stab Italy's long - time ally and Germany ended Italy's and Germany's pretty excellent 7 - year run as an alliance. Russia told Italy he was with Italy if Italy stab Austria. England told Italy he wanted Italy to solo so long as Italy would ‚Äú teach him ‚Äù and help his along to second place. Then y' all pulled the rug out from under Italy. It was clever and effective.

# ::snt Italy send to Austria that Okay, thank Austria for being true to Austria's word.      Italy think Italy and Austria is in great shape. Italy's major concern on the board right now is E / F, which is likely going to take down Germany quickly and become a major force.      It is really important to Italy to get a build here so that Italy can try to keep France in check a bit. Will Austria agree that Austria get Bulgaria, Italy get Greece, and Italy and Austria can move forward with both of Italy and Austria at 5?     Italy really think that the two of Italy and Austria can dominate this game if Italy and Austria keep working together.

# ::snt Italy send to Russia that Okay. Fair enough. One reason it might matter is because Italy could open with an aggressive attack on Austria if Russia want to blitz him quickly ( e. g. , DMZ Gal and then break it ). Or Russia could organize a bounce in Gal and then not move there. On the other hand, if Russia'd prefer to take out Turkey first, Italy could go the standard Lepanto route. Italy is happy to go either way, but Italy'd really like to coordinate with Russia if Russia is game.     Maybe Italy and Russia both need a fuller picture of what is happening first. Italy'll begin to reach out to others now.

If Italy and Russia decide to take out Austria first, Italy'd like Russia to let Austria in to Gal ( just tell him this was a mistake ).

Italy think Italy can do that, as Austria wants to take Trieste and Greece, which will open up room to maneuver. As far as Italy know, Ser is moving to Tri and Bul is moving to Gre. Italy think that Russia can take out Bud / Rum with Gal - Bud ( supported by Vie ) and Sev - Rum ( supported by Ukr ). The trick will be keeping Sev safe, but Italy think Italy and Russia can do that too, as Italy can recommend that Austria self - bounce there to keep Italy honest.

# ::snt England send to Italy that Hey. Good game. England think folks are pretty much done. England know England is ready to move on. The draw proposal combined with the impending end of the game was effective in making England and Italy slack on England's and Italy's moves a bit ( e. g. , russia skipped a build this year ). England don't know that England can say whether Italy have a clear path to a solo if England and Italy were to continue. England know germany and England could at least get MAO next year, which would put pressure on Por and Spa. England think England and Italy'd all appreciate a draw though. Otherwise it will be ‚Äú italy kind of won but kind of didn't because the game got cut short ‚Äù. Up to Italy though.

# ::snt England send to Germany that So England's reasoning is that England think France is a stronger player than either of England and Germany, or at least a more engaged one. England is getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If England help France, France probably beats England. If England and Germany defeat France together, England think England and Germany each end up with an even fighting chance.

# ::snt England send to Germany that Haha yeah that was kind of England's thinking. Russia is a little tied up in the south, and so England don't expect aggression in the north. However, france would respond to a stab by begging for Russian ( and potentially austrian and italian ) assistance. So the choice next year is between containing russia or being aggressive ( which would mean going for sweden or St. P ). England think the builds England and Germany see this winter will make it more clear what's possible.

England'd almost rather cut Pic with the channel and risk losing the channel. And England's favorite option is to support ruh to bel from nth, also risking the channel. The logic is that if England lose the channel, it won't be for very long, but if England lose a home supply center, that will be very annoying.

Basically they don't want to see Italy totally dominate this game. Germany encouraged this by saying that Italy's going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that.      Wrt the next couple years, Germany's idea is this: it's crucial that England take Mao, and that Germany take Paris. From here, England and Germany can work on beating Italy out of the Iberian, such that England end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and Germany end up with Brest and Paris ( though England can have Brest at first ). From here Germany and England is well positioned to start hitting Italy on their home turf, esp. if Russia can keep hammering away at Austria

# ::snt Germany send to England that Here's what Germany said, verbatim ( it's long. . . hope it doesn't break the bot ):    But England's desperate. Better to talk with someone than just go in blind. And Germany doubt they'd turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough / powerful enough to give real help. And there's precedent for England negotiating with someone even as England stab them: France. . . . and here's the real accusation: for all England's pretty words about a shared victory between England and Germany, England' ve been sneaky and England' ve always pitted Germany and England against each other to England's benefit. Germany's real fear here is that knowing Germany's moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking England's advice, it would be so easy to just feed England enough info to keep Germany weak while England chow down on the Island.      Germany know this from experience: back when England were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, Germany did everything Germany could to find out what England were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time - buying measure, since France was outmatched and Germany would eventually run out of pretenses to extract England's move. But Germany wanted to gain more dots before England took over. And Germany assume others are like Germany, hence Germany suspect England now.      Germany is offering this confession in hopes that England'll do the same. So just come clean and let's approach this thing as equals?

# ::snt Germany send to England that Hi England, Germany know that the last thing Germany said to England was that a partnership between Germany and England wouldn't work out, but Germany' ve had a genuine change of heart. The reason for that is that Germany think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of Germany and England ever realized; right now they may be promising England that England'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that England two will share a victory together. This is Germany's guess because these are the promises they made to Germany not so long ago. But Germany and England both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between Germany and England, and will always aid the weaker of Germany and England at the expense of the stronger.     If England is tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, Germany have a proposal that might get Germany and England both destroyed, but at least Germany and England'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting Germany. If Germany were really trying to trick England, Germany wouldn't ask something so unreasonable as that England trust Germany and England both. But frankly Germany consider knocking Italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing Germany and England can do to keep this game viable for any of Germany and England.     Germany's proposal is: NWG - Cly, Nth convoy Hol - Yor, Eng - IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre - Eng, Pic - Bre, Par - Pic, Bur - Par, Mun - Bur ( Germany figure Germany is about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens Germany'll disband Germany's Hel fleet ) Next year Germany and England'll be well - positioned to boot Italy off the island and the iberian.

If everyone does this maybe England and Germany don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved ! England is not so confident as to issue a hold for all of England's units, but will be submitting for the 5 - way draw.

Eliminating England ASAP and there's a possibility France and Russia can end up in a draw once AI tensions build. But that is impossible if they see a weak north full of infighting that they can just roll over- then they have no reason to ever turn on eachother.

# ::snt France send to England that France can stop Italy this turn by the way. It's pretty easy since Italy let France into Marseilles, France can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It's impossible to breach, France' ve checked it, and France can keep making those orders for years and years. England stabbed France in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. France think that England, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating France's ability to survive against England's onslaught. England sure this is the game England want? Slowly whittling away at France until France die? Instead, France propose that France and England let England into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that England help France defend Italy. France can send England past the MAO into West Med, where England can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. France and England wait until AI crumbles, and England have an excellent game where England top the board.

# ::snt France send to Germany that To start, France'd like France and Germany to have a good relationship, so France is starting by telling Germany what France is going to do, which is move an Army to Burgundy, ideally to bounce. This allows France to protect in case Germany were planning on doing something to begin with. Second, bouncing helps Germany out because Germany's first move with the Munich army is either to move to Burgundy or the Ruhr. If Germany do nt move to Bur, then France is there and Germany have to move the Ruhr army back to protect Mun anyway. France think France and Germany both have other issues than creating a relatively pointless stalemate here when there are better targets if France and Germany work together
