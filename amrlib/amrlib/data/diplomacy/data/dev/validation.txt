# ::snt Turkey send to Italy that The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal ( which is two coin flips ) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.     Italy is going to lose STP.     The question then becomes, how to Turkey and Italy preserve Warsaw?     Turkey's recommendation is:    A: VIE S TYR - BOH A: WAR - UKR A: STP - MOS A: BUD - GAL I: TYR - BOH I: TRI - TYR I: VEN - PIE Turkey: TUS S VEN - PIE T: SEV - UKR T: RUM S WAR - UKR T: ANK - SEV ( Convoy )     This plan destroys UKR or ensures that Turkey and Italy control it.     It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases Turkey's and Italy's odds of taking it back if Turkey and Italy loose it or maintaining it if Turkey and Italy don't.     Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.       Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw ( LVN, PRU, and SIL.     But, Turkey and Italy'll either be in Moscow or Galicia ( probably both ) and Ukraine.     Turkey and Italy'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.     The other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and Ukraine.     Turkey is willing to do as Italy suggest.

# ::snt Turkey send to Austria that The key to not losing to the solo is - assuming the loss of Portugal ( which is two coin flips ) - not losing 2 of the 3 Russian centers.     Austria is going to lose STP.     The question then becomes, how to Turkey and Austria preserve Warsaw?     Turkey's recommendation is:    A: VIE S TYR - BOH A: WAR - UKR A: STP - MOS A: BUD - GAL I: TYR - BOH I: TRI - TYR I: VEN - PIE Turkey: TUS S VEN - PIE T: SEV - UKR T: RUM S WAR - UKR T: ANK - SEV ( Convoy )     This plan destroys UKR or ensures that Turkey and Austria control it.     It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases Turkey's and Austria's odds of taking it back if Turkey and Austria loose it or maintaining it if Turkey and Austria don't.     Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.       Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw ( LVN, PRU, and SIL.     But, Turkey and Austria'll either be in Moscow or Galicia ( probably both ) and Ukraine.     Turkey and Austria'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.     The other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and Ukraine.     Turkey is willing to do as Austria suggest.

# ::snt France send to Turkey that Turkey and Austria are the most importand. Italy and England are basically out of the game anyways. France and Turkey can definitly still stop germany, but in order for that to happen Turkey and austria are going to have to stop fighting, right away, and work together to get in through germanies back door. They are sending basically all of their units to France's hometown, which means they are going to be vulnerable against Turkey guys.
