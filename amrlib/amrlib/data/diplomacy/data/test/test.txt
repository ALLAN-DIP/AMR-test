Turkey'll see if Turkey can take Rum and let Russia grab Sev back so Russia can build north, but Turkey and Russia'll come up with something !

# ::snt Turkey send to Russia that Ok, Turkey is moving down to Rum, so Russia should go GoB - StP, Ukr - Mos and either hang tight with War, or really lock down StP by doing War - Lvn.     If Russia were playing more heavily, Turkey'd suggest the opposite: tell England Russia'll not even contest StP if they take it with a fleet instead of an army, and instead throw all Russia's armies at Germany, or go with Turkey into eating Austria.     But that requires actually convincing England to go for it, and Russia don't got time for that shit right now.     So locking down StP should help, if Russia just want to move the pieces around the board. 🙂

# ::snt Germany send to England that Alright can Germany and England renegotiate? Germany is not sure what France said to sway England. Was it the three initial builds? Cuz England can have Belgium. Germany'd just really prefer to knock out France. Belgium brest and Portugal can be yours. All Germany want is Paris and Italy can take Marseilles and Spain. Really Germany and England can really negotiate however Germany'd just rather not be at odds w England. Now Germany'd figure England'd much rather ally w Germany seeing as France has struck a deal w every nation Germany' ve talked to so far which makes him not that trustworthy and he has three fleets that can easily slip in England's back door to Germany's one that England have pinned on land. . . So if England head Germany's way he's gon na walk in England's back door. Germany would bet England money. What do England say? Can Germany and England strike some sort of deal?

In the short - term then Russia have 3 to attack RUM with. Also, Russia think Turkey can hold off Russia, Italy and Austria at the same time? Turkey don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as Russia is suggesting. Also, why would Turkey be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow Russia's ally Italy to come back at Turkey by sea. And Turkey don't know where Russia get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then Russia is really going to support Turkey into RUM in the fall * as well * as the 2 Turkey got from Austria? So Russia get 1 and Turkey get 3, that's really the deal Russia is happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but Turkey and Russia both know Russia have no intention of supporting Turkey into RUM in the Fall. Russia will be attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to see that.

Russia communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as Russia didn't want to be the only one fighting Turkey and Austria. But if Turkey look at their moves, Russia and Turkey haven't really done any work together. Russia and Turkey haven't even communicated in years. If Turkey look at what they have done so far, Turkey'll see that they are a. ) a very bad player or / and b. ) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for Russia to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with Turkey would be much better.
